        <h1>Red Town Resort</h1>
        <p>At Red Town Resort, taking care of the communities we serve starts with taking care of our greatest asset – our employees. Noted for progressive employee service guarantees, Red Town Resort continues to maintain one of the lowest employee turnover rates in the hotel industry.
We offer an employee and family assistance program, as well as countless career development opportunities.
Excellence Canada, formerly the prestigious National Quality Institute, has recognized us with two Canada Awards for Excellence. We were the first hotel company in the Institute's history to be granted “Gold Trophy” awards for quality in 2000 and for our healthy workplace in 2004.  In 2007, we received the award program’s highest honour, the Order of Excellence. This distinction is Canada's top recognition for organizational excellence in the areas of leadership, performance, planning, and customer, people and supplier-focused operations. In October 2009, Red Town Resort was inducted into Excellence Canada’s Canadian Hall of Excellence.
Red Town Resort and Resorts named one of Canada’s 50 Best Employers
Red Town Resort is also consistently ranked for 15 years as one of "The 50 Best Employers in Canada" by Aon Hewitt.
